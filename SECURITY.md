# Security Policy

At Weaveworks we take security very seriously, and value our close relationship with members of the security community.

## Supported Versions

As an Open Source project, only the latest code has all fixes and security patches.
If you require a higher level of commitment, please [contact Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/contact/) to discuss.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To submit a security bug report please e-mail us at security@weave.works.

We also operate a Bug Bounty programme; see https://www.weave.works/bug-bounty/
