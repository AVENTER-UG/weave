## Documentation status

The public documentation that used to exist in the `site` directory has been moved to the `original/site` directory. A new `website` directory has been created, and populated with the content of the `original/site` directory, rearranged and reformatted for being built with Jekyll and published to the GitHub pages site [https://aventer-ug.github.io/weave](https://aventer-ug.github.io/weave).

The documentation will now be maintained and published from the `website` directory exclusively.
